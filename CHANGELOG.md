- **Enhancement**: Rewrite graph resolution using topological sorting to vastly improve performance and simplify generation.
- **Enhancement**: Return early once an externally-compiled dependency graph is found.

- **Fix**: Fix assertion error for generated multibinding name hint when using both @Multibinds and @ElementsIntoSet for the same multibinding.
- **Fix**: Fix contributed graph extensions not inheriting empty declared multibindings.
- **Fix**: Ensure we report the `@Multibinds` declaration location in errors if one is available.
- **Fix**: Dedupe overrides by all parameters not just value parameters.
- **Fix**: Dedupe overrides by signature rather than name when generating contributed graphs.
- **Fix**: Fix accidentally adding contributed graphs as child elements of parent graphs twice.
- **Fix**: Fix not deep copying `extensionReceiverParameter` when implementing fake overrides in contributed graphs.
- **Fix**: Report fully qualified qualifier renderings in diagnostics.
- **Fix**: Don't generate provider fields for multibinding elements unnecessarily.
- When debug logging + reports dir is enabled, output a `logTrace.txt` to the reports dir for tracing data.
- Update to Kotlin `2.1.21`.

0.3.0
-----

_2025-05-05_

- **New**: Add support for `@ContributesGraphExtension`! See the [docs](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/dependency-graphs#contributed-graph-extensions) for more info.
- **New**: Add a `asContribution()` compiler intrinsic to upcast graphs to expected contribution types. For example: `val contributedInterface = appGraph.asContribution<ContributedInterface>()`. This is validated at compile-time.
- **New**: Automatically transform `@Provides` functions to be `private`. This is enabled by defaults and supersedes the `publicProviderSeverity` when enabled, and can be disabled via the Gradle extension or `transform-providers-to-private` compiler option. Note that properties and providers with any annotations with `KClass` arguments are not supported yet pending upstream kotlinc changes.
- **Enhancement**: Rewrite the internal `BindingGraph` implementation to be more performant, accurate, and testable.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostic to check that graph factories don't provide their target graphs as parameters.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostic to check that a primary scope is defined if any additionalScopes are also defined on a graph annotation.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostic to validate that contributed types do not have narrower visibility that aggregating graphs. i.e. detect if you accidentally try to contribute an `internal` type to a `public` graph.
- **Enhancement**: Optimize supertype lookups when building binding classes by avoiding previously visited classes.
- **Enhancement**: Don't generate hints for contributed types with non-public API visibility.
- **Enhancement**: When reporting duplicate binding errors where one of the bindings is contributed, report the contributing class in the error message.
- **Enhancement**: When reporting scope incompatibility, check any extended parents match the scope and suggest a workaround in the error diagnostic.
- **Enhancement**: Allow AssistedFactory methods to be protected.
- **Fix**: Fix incremental compilation when a parent graph or supertype modifies/removes a provider.
- **Fix**: Fix rank processing error when the outranked binding is contributed using Metro's ContributesBinding annotation.
- **Fix**: Fix `@Provides` graph parameters not getting passed on to extended child graphs.
- **Fix**: Fix qualifiers on bindings not getting seen by extended child graphs.
- **Fix**: Fix qualifiers getting ignored on accessors from `@Includes` dependencies.
- **Fix**: Fix transitive scoped dependencies not always getting initialized first in graph provider fields.
- **Fix**: Fix injected `lateinit var` properties being treated as if they have default values.
- **Fix**: Alias bindings not always having their backing type visited during graph validation.
- **Fix**: Fix race condition in generating parent graphs first even if child graph is encountered first in processing.
- **Fix**: Fallback `AssistedInjectChecker` error report to the declaration source.
- **Fix**: Fix missing parent supertype bindings in graph extensions.
- **Change**: `InstanceFactory` is no longer a value class. This wasn't going to offer much value in practice.
- **Change**: Change debug reports dir to be per-compilation rather than per-platform.

0.2.0
-----

_2025-04-21_

- **New**: Nullable bindings are now allowed! See the [nullability docs](https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/bindings#nullability) for more info.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostics for multibindings with star projections.
- **Enhancement**: Add diagnostic for map multibindings with nullable keys.
- **Fix**: Ensure assisted factories' target bindings' parameters are processed in MetroGraph creation. Previously, these weren't processed and could result in scoped bindings not being cached.
- **Fix**: Fix duplicate field accessors generated for graph supertypes.
- Add [compose navigation sample](https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/tree/main/samples/compose-navigation-app).

0.1.3
-----

_2025-04-18_

- **Change**: Multibindings may not be empty by default. To allow an empty multibinding, `@Multibinds(allowEmpty = true)` must be explicitly declared now.
- **New**: Write graph metadata to reports (if enabled).
- **New**: Support configuring debug and reports globally via `metro.debug` and `metro.reportsDestination` Gradle properties (respectively).
- **Enhancement**: Change how aggregation hints are generated to improve incremental compilation. Externally contributed hints are now looked up lazily per-scope instead of all at once.
- **Enhancement**: Optimize empty map multibindings to reuse a singleton instance.
- **Enhancement**: Report error diagnostic if Dagger's `@Reusable` is used on a provider or injected class.
- **Enhancement**: Tweak diagnostic error strings for members so that IDE terminals auto-link them better. i.e., instead of printing `example.AppGraph.provideString`, Metro will print `example.AppGraph#provideString` instead.
- **Enhancement**: Support repeatable @ContributesBinding annotations with different scopes.
- **Fix**: Fix incremental compilation when `@Includes`-annotated graph parameters change accessor signatures.
- **Fix**: Don't allow graph extensions to use the same scope as any extended ancestor graphs.
- **Fix**: Don't allow multiple ancestor graphs of graph extensions to use the same scope.
- **Fix**: Handle scenarios where the compose-compiler plugin runs _before_ Metro's when generating wrapper classes for top-level `@Composable` functions.
- **Fix**: Fix an edge case in graph extensions where child graphs would miss a provided scoped binding in a parent graph that was also exposed as an accessor.
- **Fix**: Fix Dagger interop issue when calling Javax/Jakarta/Dagger providers from Metro factories.
- **Fix**: Fix Dagger interop issue when calling `dagger.Lazy` from Metro factories.
- **Fix**: Preserve the original `Provider` or `Lazy` type used in injected types when generating factory creators.
- Temporarily disable hint generation in WASM targets to avoid file count mismatches until [KT-75865](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-75865).
- Add an Android sample: https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/tree/main/samples/android-app
- Add a multiplatform Circuit sample: https://github.com/ZacSweers/metro/tree/main/samples/circuit-app
- Add samples docs: https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/samples
- Add FAQ docs: https://zacsweers.github.io/metro/faq

0.1.2
-----

_2025-04-08_

- **Enhancement**: Implement `createGraph` and `createGraphFactory` FIR checkers for better error diagnostics on erroneous type arguments.
- **Enhancement**: Add `ContributesBinding.rank` interop support with Anvil.
- **Enhancement**: Check Kotlin version compatibility. Use the `metro.version.check=false` Gradle property to disable these warnings if you're feeling adventurous.
- **Fix**: Fix class-private qualifiers on multibinding contributions in other modules not being recognized in downstream graphs.
- **Fix**: Fix member injectors not getting properly visited in graph validation.
- **Fix**: Fix a bug where `Map<Key, Provider<Value>>` multibindings weren't always unwrapped correctly.
- **Fix**: Fix `Map<Key, Provider<Value>>` type keys not correctly interpreting the underlying type key as `Map<Key, Value>`.
- **Change**: Change `InstanceFactory` to a value class.
- **Change**: Make `providerOf` use `InstanceFactory` under the hood.
